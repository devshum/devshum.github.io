The quite simple, well-organized adaptive project on Flexbox basis. There I used BEM | SCSS | slightly JS :) 

*The design I took from the internet.

This HTML markup is absolutely huge :D I used CSS GRID | BEM | SCSS | well-adaprive backgrounds that depend on width or device pixel ratio, that's nice

I think that I managed to implement my CSS GRID knowledge greatly, i'm glad that in 2019 this technology has the support 90% or even more
