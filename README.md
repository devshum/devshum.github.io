I really enjoyed to make this HTML markup because I absolutely like this kind of static websites like a blog or something similar

In the work I used the same things as below which base on Flexbox and so on...
This markup also has a good support in 'The W3C Markup Validation Service', 'PageSpeed Insights' and has well-compressed images

In the next markup I mean to make an old-standart site on Floats(some grid system) and PUG, because as I consider that kind of markup must be in a portfolio in spite of modern technologies like CSS Grid or Flexbox etc.

*The design made by my dear friend Arthur Berg.

The quite simple, well-organized adaptive project on Flexbox basis. There I used BEM , SCSS , slightly JS :) 

*The design I took from the internet.

This HTML markup is absolutely huge :D I used CSS GRID , BEM , SCSS , well-adaprive backgrounds that depend on width or device pixel ratio, that's nice

I think that I managed to implement my CSS GRID knowledge greatly, i'm glad that in 2019 this technology has the support 90% or even more
